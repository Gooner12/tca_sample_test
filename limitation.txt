Limitation and assumptions:
1) The relevant tech industries are selected based on the information available on the labour market information portal,
and there is a chance that there is an inclusion of non-tech roles in those selected industries. 

2) While selecting the relevant tech occupations, a short research and personal judgement was used. So, there might
be a presence in judgemental bias in the occupation selection process. Also, certain occupation titles such as 
technicians and trade workers might include non tech people too. On the other hand, occupations such as chief
executives, administrative workers,etc., are present in the tech sector even though they seem non-technical jobs.
In this analysis, we have omitted such non-technical sounding jobs. Thus, in the occupation selection process, we
might be including some non tech people and excluding some tech people.This is one of the limitations of our 
analysis.

3) The old definition of states and territories are assumed to be the same as the present day states and territories.
In our data preprocessing steps, we merged different divided geographical regions into a single state, such as 
NSW, Greater Sydney, Sydney, into NSW. This transformation has beed applied to relevant states.
